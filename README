ZE: Zen Explorer
================
ZE is a file explorer that runs in the terminal. It aims at making your file exploring in the terminal as
pleasant as possible!

Requirements

* https://www.gnu.org/software/make
* https://git-scm.com/downloads or https://github.com/cli/cli#installation

Install
-------
To install, simply:

How to use
-----------
When ZE is opened, you will be greeted with the *classic* tcsh "%" prompt.
It operates by using "keys" for controlling the file system.
These are the keys and their respective commands:

* 1: View files
* 2: Change directory
* 3: Create file
* 4: Delete file
* 5: Run custom command
* 6: Exit explorer

With some commands, you will be asked for further input. That's when the ">" prompt appears.
If you get an error, it will be prefixed with "[ERROR]:" & if an info message appears, it
will be prefixed with "[INFO]:".  
  
So yeah, enjoy the project!
