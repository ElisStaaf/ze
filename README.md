ZE is a file explorer that runs in the terminal. It aims at making your file exploring in the terminal as pleasant as possible!

Requirements
------------
* C compiler (clang, gcc etc.)
* Make
* Git or Github CLI (optional)

Install
-------
To install, simply:
```bash
# Git
git clone https://github.com/ElisStaaf/ze

# Gh
gh repo clone ElisStaaf/ze
```
You could maybe install with cURL, but why bother? Because you *do* have git on your system, yes? Well, anyways, then you need to
install ZE as a binary:
```bash
sudo make install
```
Then you can, well, use the editor.
